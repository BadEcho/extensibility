The `BadEcho.Extensibility.Extensions` library integrates the Bad Echo Extensibility framework with the Microsoft.Extensions.* family of libraries and the dependency injection container they use. Using this library will allow for various services and features registered with an application host to be able to be discovered using the Extensibility framework's plugin host.

This package exists to be used by specific Bad Echo applications, but is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License so that others may enjoy it as well; see the accompanying [license](https://github.com/BadEcho/extensibility/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, it also focuses on game development and providing entertainment through the clever manipulation of games (the results of which are streamed by myself).

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
